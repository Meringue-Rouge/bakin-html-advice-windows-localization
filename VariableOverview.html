            <p>This screen allows you to list the <span class="term">[Variables]</span> specified in the game. You can also rewrite the contents of events using <span class="term">[Variables]</span> from this screen.</p>
            <p>This screen lists all the <span class="term">[Variables]</span> used for events in the game. By looking at this table and following how the contents of <span class="term">[Variables]</span> are changing, you can check if the flow of events is working correctly.</p>
            <p>Clicking on a variable also opens the event sheet in which the variable is used, allowing you to immediately modify the usage of the variable in the event.</p>
            <p><span class="term">[Variables]</span> that can store information such as <span class="term">[numbers]</span>, <span class="term">[strings]</span>, and <span class="term">[switches]</span> that change within a game are very useful in creating events.</p>
            <p>Try to take advantage of this screen!</p>
            <p>If you are not sure what to do, please refer to the <span class="term">[RPG Developer Bakin Manual]</span> from Help.</p>
