            <p>This screen allows you to create animations <span class="term">[Sprites]</span> that can be used in the game. 2D images can be combined and the display timing, position, angle, etc. can be specified to create a display object in motion.</p>
            <p><span class="term">[Sprites]</span> are mainly used for 2D effects displayed in battles and events, animations of the <span class="term">[Casts]</span> used in conversation scenes, and menu items that move. You can also create <span class="term">[Display object movements]</span> such as fade-outs and slide-ins and use them in <span class="term">[Layout Tool]</span> and so on.</p>
            <p>Register the image you wish to display in the <span class="term">[Layer]</span> section of the timeline, and specify information such as how the image will be changed. Then, by adding the next frame and specifying how the image changes from the previous frame, a <span class="term">[Sprite]</span> with movement is created.</p>
            <p><span class="term">[Sprite]</span> can be used in a variety of ways, depending on your creativity. Try it out!</p>
            <p>If you are not sure what to do, please refer to the <span class="term">[RPG Developer Bakin Manual]</span> from Help.</p>
