            <p>This screen manages all resources (asset data) such as graphics and sounds that appear in the game. Resources can be added or removed, and each can be configured in detail.</p>
            <p>RPG Developer Bakin’s resources can be divided into three main categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Terrain Stamps</strong><br>These are the so-called map chips that make up maps. Several attributes can be specified, such as “Non-Traversable”.</li>
                <li><strong>Object Stamps</strong><br>With the exception of events, almost everything placed on maps, whether 2D or 3D, are <span class="term">[Object Stamps]</span>. A <span class="term">[Stamp]</span> is an object that combines elements such as “model” and “texture” into a single object and then adds additional attributes to it. Basically, anything placed on maps needs to be a <span class="term">[Stamp]</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Others</strong><br>These are resources that are not <span class="term">[Stamps]</span>, such as sounds, movies, and general-purpose data used in various parts of the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="term">[Resources]</span> is a very multifunctional screen, so there is no need to know every detail at first. When you want to make more detailed adjustments to the game, you can check again to see how each parameter is working.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure what to do, please refer to the <span class="term">[RPG Developer Bakin Manual]</span> from Help.</p>
