            <p>This screen specifies the basic settings and common rules for the game to be created. It allows you to specify the main cast, basic rules such as the maximum number of items that can be owned, the size of the game screen, how to control the game, and the in-game language.</p>
            <p>First, let’s specify the game’s main cast, initial party members, etc. in the <span class="term">[Start Settings]</span> section. Before doing so, it is a good idea to open the <span class="term">[Database]</span> menu from the <span class="term">[Map Editor]</span> and create some <span class="term">[Casts]</span> (characters in this game).</p>
            <p>Also, in the <span class="term">[Project Settings]</span> section, you may want to specify the resolution at which you want to run the game you have created.</p>
            <p>Take a peek at <span class="term">[Rules and Operations]</span>, <span class="term">[Common Terms]</span> and <span class="term">[System Resources]</span>, and try out the settings that suit the game you want to create.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure what to do, please refer to the <span class="term">[RPG Developer Bakin Manual]</span> from Help.</p>
