            <p>This is the main screen of RPG Developer Bakin, which creates maps that serve as the stage for the game. Create the “world of your imagination” by tweaking the terrain, placing objects, and events.</p>
            <p>First, click on the map and click on the little toolbar button that comes up and play with it to move the ground up or down.</p>
            <p>Next, click on one terrain from the <span class="term">[Terrains]</span> tab in the row of thumbnails on the right side of the screen, and try dragging the mouse over the map. In addition, switch the tab with thumbnails to <span class="term">[Objects]</span> and click on the object of your choice to place it on the map.</p>
            <p>Then you can tweak each button on the <span class="term">[Map Editor]</span> as you like and see how it functions. There are many menus and buttons that are easy to understand because the effects are immediately apparent when you use them.</p>
            <p>You can see how the map can be created as if you were drawing a picture.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure what to do, please refer to the <span class="term">[RPG Developer Bakin Manual]</span> from Help.</p>
