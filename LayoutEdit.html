            <p>This screen allows you to change the appearance of various screens and menus displayed in the game. You can also specify the image, position, and movement of parts to be displayed on the screen, and change the screen that opens when a button is selected on the menu.</p>
            <p>First, from the <span class="term">[Screen List]</span> on the left side of the screen, select which screen layout you would like to change to be used in which scene.</p>
            <p>Multiple layouts can be created for each scene. During the game, you can specify which one to use by using <span class="term">[Layout to be Assigned]</span> on the left side of the screen or <span class="term">[Layout to be Opened]</span> in Properties.</p>
            <p>Layouts can also be switched by events. It would be interesting to change the conversation window or the menu display according to the progress of the story.</p>
            <p>The layouts used in games are intertwined with the game system and therefore also require complex specifications to control. While using the default layout and the layout of the sample game <span class="term">[Orb Stories]</span> as a reference for your creation, try changing the layout, which can greatly affect the atmosphere of the game!</p>
            <p>If you are not sure what to do, please refer to the <span class="term">[RPG Developer Bakin Manual]</span> from Help.</p>
